## Cross-Mart Analysis Examples

### Find underperforming muscle groups
```sql
-- Muscle groups with low frequency but high recent volume
SELECT 
    mgf.muscle_group,
    mgf.times_trained,
    mgf.days_since_last_trained,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ef.exercise_name) as exercise_variety
FROM muscle_group_frequency mgf
LEFT JOIN exercise_frequency ef ON mgf.muscle_group = ef.muscle_group
GROUP BY mgf.muscle_group, mgf.times_trained, mgf.days_since_last_trained
HAVING mgf.times_trained < 5 OR mgf.days_since_last_trained > 14
ORDER BY mgf.days_since_last_trained DESC;
```

### Training consistency correlation with PRs
```sql

SELECT 
    tp.dimension_label as month,
    tp.metric_count as monthly_workouts,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pr.exercise_name) as exercises_with_pr
FROM training_patterns tp
LEFT JOIN personal_records pr 
    ON CAST(YEAR(pr.current_pr_date) AS VARCHAR) || '-' || LPAD(CAST(MONTH(pr.current_pr_date) AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = tp.dimension
WHERE tp.analysis_type = 'monthly_analysis'
GROUP BY tp.dimension_label, tp.metric_count
ORDER BY tp.dimension_label DESC;
```

### Best training day for PRs
```sql
-- Which day of the week produces the most PRs?
SELECT 
    CASE DAY_OF_WEEK(pr.current_pr_date)
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Monday'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Tuesday'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Wednesday'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Thursday'
        WHEN 5 THEN 'Friday'
        WHEN 6 THEN 'Saturday'
        WHEN 7 THEN 'Sunday'
    END as day_name,

## Extending the Marts

To add new marts or extend existing ones:

1. **Identify the business question**: What specific question are you trying to answer?
2. **Determine required data**: Which staging models do you need?
3. **Create the mart**: Write SQL in `models/marts/your_mart_name.sql`
4. **Document in schema.yml**: Add model and column descriptions
5. **Add tests**: Create data quality tests in `tests/` directory
6. **Update documentation**: Add to this guide and main READMEs
7. **Test locally**: Run `dbt run --models your_mart_name`

For more details, see the "Extending with New Business Questions" section in the main README.
